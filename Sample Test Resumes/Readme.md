Skill Extraction Not Working?
If the app doesn't extract skills from your uploaded resume, it may be due to:

    -The resume format (image-based/scanned PDFs not supported)

    -Lack of recognizable tech keywords (like JavaScript, React, etc.)

    -File encoding issues

->To test the system, you can upload one of the Sample Test Resumes provided

Once uploaded, the system will extract skills and display personalized job recommendations based on the keywords.
