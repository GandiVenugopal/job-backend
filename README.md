Features:
JWT-based user authentication (register/login)
Resume upload and storage in AWS S3
Skill extraction from resumes

The frontend is built using React.js (Vite) and deployed on Vercel. It connects to the backend via secure REST APIs and enables users to:

1. User Registration / Login
   
    -Users visit the app and can sign up with their name, email, and password.
   
    -Passwords are hashed securely and authenticated via JWT tokens.
   
    -On successful login, a token is saved in localStorage for authenticated access.

2. Resume Upload + Skill Extraction
   
    -Authenticated users can upload their resume in PDF or DOCX format.
   
    -The file is uploaded to AWS S3.
   
    -On the backend, a basic NLP parser extracts keywords/skills from the resume content.
   
    -Extracted skills are stored with the userâ€™s profile in MongoDB.

3. Job Recommendation
    
    -After skill extraction, the user can view AI-powered job recommendations.
   
    -The system matches user skills with fetched job listings using keyword comparison.
   
    -Jobs are scraped via the JSearch API, saved in MongoDB, and filtered based on skills.
